# Front-end incudes 4 component folders - Home page / Lessons / Instruments / Contact Us
# Each page includes html,css,typescript
# use html css to make front end and add pictures and typescript to tie frontend to database

# Back-end code is in Flask framework using python
# In our Models page, we create a class for each section we populate into our database, i.e. class for instruments/lessons/customers
# In our Routes page, we create our API routes for creating/updating/deleting instruments/lessons/customers
# In our App page, we configure our database and reference the link on AWS
# Note that we have our back on hosted on Heroku and the server hosted on AWS

# We use typescript in each method so that our buttons can fire off information to and from our database
# for example, the home page register button will take in a value of name and email and reference the submit method to populate a persons name and email into the database

# Future work will include using stripe to add a payment system to  the instruments
